# Fly.io Deployment Optimization PR

## Overview
This PR improves the Fly.io deployment configuration to resolve timeout issues during application startup. It significantly enhances deployment reliability by extending timeout periods, optimizing resource allocation, and improving container configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fly.io Configuration Optimizations (`fly.toml`)
- ✅ Extended health check grace period from 30s to 300s
- ✅ Increased health check interval from 15s to 60s
- ✅ Extended health check timeout from 10s to 30s
- ✅ Upgraded VM resources to 2GB RAM and 2 CPUs (from 1GB/1CPU)
- ✅ Added immediate deployment strategy
- ✅ Added release command delay for better startup handling

### 2. Container Optimizations (`Dockerfile`)
- ✅ Optimized Gunicorn settings for better performance:
  - Increased timeout from 120s to 300s
  - Added graceful timeout of 120s
  - Configured max requests and jitter for stability
  - Optimized keep-alive settings
- ✅ Added compilation flags for Python packages to improve runtime performance
- ✅ Added optimization preparation command

### 3. Deployment Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `DEPLOY.md` with detailed instructions
- ✅ Added extensive troubleshooting section for common deployment issues
- ✅ Documented environment variable setup process
- ✅ Added deployment verification steps

### 4. Deployment Script
- ✅ Created `ppb_deploy.sh` with maximum timeout settings (30min)
- ✅ Added optimal region (sjc) and VM size settings
- ✅ Implemented automatic status checking and error handling
- ✅ Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 5. Deployment Commands
- ✅ Created `DEPLOY_COMMAND.txt` with optimized deployment commands
- ✅ Configured maximum timeout value (1800s = 30min)
- ✅ Added region-specific deployment options
- ✅ Added performance-optimized VM settings

## Testing
The updated configuration has been successfully deployed to Fly.io, resolving the previous timeout issues during application startup.

## Implementation Notes
- These changes don't affect the application code, only deployment configuration
- The increased resource allocation may slightly increase hosting costs
- Future deployments should use the provided script or commands with extended timeouts
